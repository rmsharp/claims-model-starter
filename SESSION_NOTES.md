# Session Notes

**Purpose:** Continuity between sessions. Each session reads this first and writes to it before closing out.

---

## ACTIVE TASK
**Task:** Phase 2A of the architecture plan — Data Agent core + LangGraph
**Status:** Phase 1 (schemas + registry + envelope + 88 unit tests) complete at commit TBD on branch `master`. Next session implements the Data Agent's `run(request) -> DataReport` against a seeded SQLite DB.
**Plan:** `docs/planning/architecture-plan.md` §14 Phase 2 (Sub-phase 2A) defines exactly what DONE looks like and verification commands.
**Priority:** HIGH

### What You Must Do
1. **Re-read the plan sections that govern this phase before writing any code:**
   - §4.2 — Data Agent responsibility, I/O contract, failure modes (especially the `NOT_EXECUTED` / `INVALID` / `INCOMPLETE_REQUEST` branches)
   - §7 — **The decoupling rule.** Data Agent code must not import `IntakeReport`. The decoupling test from §7 ships in this phase and must pass in CI.
   - §10.2 — The Data Agent LangGraph (GENERATE_QUERIES → GENERATE_QC → EXECUTE_QC → SUMMARIZE → DATASHEET) with the two off-ramps (RETRY_ONCE on bad SQL, SKIP_EXECUTION on DB down)
   - §12 — Error handling contract: return a report with `status != COMPLETE`, do NOT raise for expected failures
2. Execute **only Sub-phase 2A** from §14:
   - `src/model_project_constructor/agents/data/` with the LangGraph flow from §10
   - `DataAgent.run(request: DataRequest) -> DataReport` works end-to-end against a test SQLite DB seeded by a fixture
   - SQL parse validation via `sqlparse`
   - Datasheet generation for one seeded query
   - Decoupling test at `tests/test_data_agent_decoupling.py` (AST-walks the data agent source, asserts no `IntakeReport` imports) passes
3. Verify with §14 Phase 2A's commands.
4. **Do NOT start Sub-phase 2B (standalone package + CLI + Python API).** That is the next session.

### Key Files from Phase 1 (already implemented)
- `src/model_project_constructor/schemas/v1/data.py:21-98` — `DataRequest`, `DataReport`, `DataGranularity`, `QualityCheck`, `PrimaryQuery`, `Datasheet`. **Already forbids imports from intake.py** (see module docstring).
- `src/model_project_constructor/schemas/v1/common.py:13-31` — `StrictBase` (extra="forbid", protected_namespaces=()) and literal aliases. Inherit from `StrictBase` for any new payload types.
- `src/model_project_constructor/schemas/envelope.py:22-36` — `HandoffEnvelope`. Persist each Data Agent hand-off as an envelope per §6.
- `src/model_project_constructor/schemas/registry.py:26-34` — `REGISTRY`. **If you add any new payload types in Phase 2A, register them here** or the schema-registry test will fail.
- `pyproject.toml:18-27` — `[project.optional-dependencies].agents` already lists `langgraph`, `anthropic`, `sqlparse`, `sqlalchemy`. Install via `uv sync --extra agents`.
- `docs/planning/architecture-plan.md` — **THE PLAN**. §4.2, §7, §10, §12, §14 Phase 2A are in scope.

### Gotchas — Read These First
- **`uv` is not installed on this dev machine.** Session 3 ran tests with `python3 -m pytest` (system Python 3.10 + `pytest 9.0.2` + `pydantic 2.12.5`). `pyproject.toml` is uv-compatible (PEP 621 + hatchling) and pins `requires-python = ">=3.11"`, but the local interpreter is 3.10. Schemas work on 3.10 because they only use PEP 604 unions and `typing.Literal`. If you need `StrEnum` or `tomllib` in Phase 2A, you will hit this. First action of Phase 2A: `which uv || brew install uv` (or equivalent) and pin a 3.11+ interpreter via `uv python install 3.11`.
- **Python version mismatch risk for LangGraph.** The plan pins `langgraph 0.2.x`; verify on 3.11+ before investing in the interrupt/checkpoint pattern. Session 2 flagged this as an unverified assumption — Phase 2A is the first phase that actually exercises LangGraph, so **verify the interrupt pattern on a toy graph before wiring the real flow**.
- **The decoupling test is THE structural guarantee of the whole design.** Do not mark Phase 2A complete until it is green AND fails as expected when you temporarily add `from model_project_constructor.schemas.v1 import IntakeReport` to a data-agent module. A decoupling test that never fires is theater, not a test.
- **Do not widen the `StrictBase` config just because a test fails.** `extra="forbid"` caught real producer typos in Session 3's tests. If a new test fails with "extra inputs not permitted," that is the correct behavior — fix the producer, don't relax the config.
- **`DataRequest` has required-but-nullable `database_hint: str | None = None`** (default `None`). This matches the plan's "optional context" comment. If you see `database_hint` required without a default in code review, it is a regression from Session 3's interpretation.
- **Pydantic v2 `model_` namespace protection** is disabled via `StrictBase.model_config.protected_namespaces = ()` because we have domain fields named `model_solution`, `model_type`, `model_registry_entry`. Do not re-enable it without renaming those fields.
- **Data Agent status field has THREE values, not two:** `COMPLETE`, `INCOMPLETE_REQUEST`, `EXECUTION_FAILED`. The status machine in the LangGraph flow needs to set each one explicitly in the appropriate error branch.
- **The plan says agents do NOT raise for expected failures (§12).** LangGraph nodes may raise internally for flow control, but the outer `DataAgent.run()` must catch and return a report.

### How You Will Be Evaluated
Your handoff will be scored on:
1. Was the ACTIVE TASK block sufficient to orient the next session?
2. Were key files listed with line numbers or section references?
3. Were gotchas and traps flagged?
4. Was the "what's next" actionable and specific?
5. Did you complete Phase 2A as defined, or did you bundle Sub-phase 2B?

### What Session 4 Did
**Deliverable:** Phase 2A of architecture plan — Data Agent core + LangGraph (IN PROGRESS)
**Started:** 2026-04-14
**Status:** Session claimed. Phase 0 orientation complete. Work beginning on environment bootstrap (uv + Python 3.11) and re-reading plan §4.2/§7/§10.2/§12/§14 Phase 2A before any code.

### What Session 3 Did
**Deliverable:** Phase 1 of architecture plan — Repo Skeleton + Schemas (COMPLETE)
**Started:** 2026-04-14
**Completed:** 2026-04-14
**Commit:** See git log for hash

**What was done (chronological):**
1. Phase 0 orientation — read SAFEGUARDS, SESSION_NOTES, architecture-plan.md in full (both halves), checked git, reported, waited for direction.
2. Phase 1B session stub written to SESSION_NOTES.md before any technical work.
3. Probed environment: `uv` not installed; system Python is 3.10.12 with pydantic 2.12.5 and pytest 9.0.2 already available. Decided to keep `pyproject.toml` strictly compliant with the plan (requires-python >=3.11, uv-ready) and run local tests via `python3 -m pytest`, flagging the Python-version gap for Phase 2A.
4. Wrote `pyproject.toml` — PEP 621 + hatchling, `model-project-constructor` package at `src/model_project_constructor`, core dep `pydantic>=2.6,<3`, optional groups `agents` / `ui` / `dev`. Pytest config includes `pythonpath = ["src"]` so tests run without manual `PYTHONPATH`. Per-session-3 user directive, added `pytest-cov` with `--cov-fail-under=80`.
5. Implemented `schemas/v1/common.py` (`StrictBase` with `extra="forbid"`, `protected_namespaces=()`, plus `CycleTime`, `RiskTier`, `ModelType`, `SCHEMA_VERSION`).
6. Implemented `schemas/v1/intake.py` — `ModelSolution`, `EstimatedValue`, `GovernanceMetadata`, `IntakeReport`. All inherit `StrictBase`.
7. Implemented `schemas/v1/data.py` — `DataGranularity`, `DataRequest`, `QualityCheck`, `Datasheet`, `PrimaryQuery`, `DataReport`. Module docstring forbids importing from `intake.py` (runtime AST test comes in Phase 2A per the plan).
8. Implemented `schemas/v1/gitlab.py` — `GitLabTarget`, `GovernanceManifest`, `GitLabProjectResult`.
9. Implemented `schemas/v1/__init__.py` re-exporting everything public.
10. Implemented `schemas/envelope.py` — `HandoffEnvelope` with its own `envelope_version="1.0.0"` and `payload: dict[str, Any]` (resolved by registry, not by envelope).
11. Implemented `schemas/registry.py` — `REGISTRY`, `SchemaKey`, `UnknownPayloadError(KeyError)`, `load_payload(envelope)`.
12. Wrote `tests/schemas/fixtures.py` — `make_*` factories for every schema.
13. Wrote `tests/schemas/test_intake.py`, `test_data.py`, `test_gitlab.py`, `test_envelope_and_registry.py` — 88 tests total.
14. `python3 -m pytest tests/schemas/ -v` → **88 passed in 0.13s**. Coverage on the `schemas` package is 100%.
15. Ran §14 Phase 1 smoke tests — both import checks pass; `len(REGISTRY) == 5`.
16. Rewrote ACTIVE TASK for Phase 2A and wrote this closeout.

**Key design calls:**
- `StrictBase` centralizes `ConfigDict(extra="forbid", protected_namespaces=())`. Avoids 14 copies of model_config and avoids the `model_` warning on `model_solution`/`model_type`/`model_registry_entry`.
- `UnknownPayloadError` inherits from `KeyError` (dict-lookup semantics); pydantic `ValidationError` remains separate for bad payloads.
- `target_variable: str | None` and `annual_impact_usd_low/high: float | None` are **required-nullable** (no default) — matches the plan's literal code. If Phase 2A finds this too strict, relax to `= None`.
- `database_hint` and `regulatory_mapping` have explicit defaults because the plan marks them "optional context."
- Decoupling rule is enforced textually in `data.py`'s docstring; runtime AST test is a Phase 2A deliverable per §14.
- Tests use `pytest.mark.parametrize` on every literal-enum field so adding a value is a one-line test change. Explicit regression guard against `default_factory` aliasing on `GovernanceManifest.regulatory_mapping`.

**Files created (17):**
- `pyproject.toml`
- `src/model_project_constructor/{__init__.py, schemas/__init__.py, schemas/envelope.py, schemas/registry.py, schemas/v1/{__init__,common,intake,data,gitlab}.py}`
- `tests/{__init__.py, schemas/{__init__,fixtures,test_intake,test_data,test_gitlab,test_envelope_and_registry}.py}`

**Session 2 Handoff Evaluation (Session 3 scoring Session 2):**
- **Score: 9/10**
- **What helped:** The ACTIVE TASK block was surgical — task, plan location, exact subsections to obey, explicit "do NOT start Phase 2," five-bullet evaluation rubric. The Gotchas section flagged four concrete traps; three were load-bearing for Session 3. Reading the plan + handoff took ~8 minutes and saved an estimated 45+ minutes of discovery.
- **What was missing:**
  - **No mention that `uv` was not installed on this machine.** Session 2 wrote "`uv` is the package manager" as a directive but did not verify it was available. ~2 minutes of probing.
  - **No flag that local Python is 3.10 while the plan pins 3.11+.** Latent trap for Phase 2A if LangGraph needs 3.11-only features.
  - The plan's `| None` comment syntax is ambiguous about required-nullable vs. optional-with-default. I had to make judgment calls on `target_variable`, the annual-impact bounds, and `database_hint`.
- **What was wrong:** Nothing factually wrong. Minor gap: the handoff references the `model_governance` project as the source of `GovernanceMetadata` but does not give its path.
- **ROI:** Very high. The plan was the valuable artifact; the handoff was a precise index.
- **Process note:** Session 2 correctly wrote a Phase 1B stub and held the planning-vs-implementation line.

**Session 3 Self-Assessment:**
- (+) Scope discipline. Phase 1 only. No agent code, no LangGraph, no adapters, no decoupling test — all Phase 2A.
- (+) Phase 1B stub written before any technical work.
- (+) All §14 Phase 1 verification commands green (pytest + both imports + `len(REGISTRY)`).
- (+) Tests exercise non-obvious cases: extra-field rejection, every literal value, serialization round-trip for every top-level schema, `load_payload` happy paths plus three failure modes, mutable-default aliasing regression guard.
- (+) Proactive abstractions (`StrictBase`, `SchemaKey`) only where they prevented repetition; no speculative generalization.
- (+) Module-level decoupling comment in `data.py` captures the §7 rule textually even without the runtime test.
- (+) Phase 2A gotchas are concrete: `uv`/Python 3.10 mismatch, unverified LangGraph interrupt pattern, three-valued status field, `extra="forbid"` discipline, `model_` namespace override, decoupling test must actually fire.
- (−) Did not install `uv`. Tests ran via `python3 -m pytest`; equivalent to `uv run pytest` but not the literal plan commands.
- (−) Local Python is 3.10; pyproject targets 3.11+. Works today because the schema code is 3.10-compatible; may bite Phase 2A.
- (−) `annual_impact_usd_low/high` are required-nullable. If intake agent has to pass `None` 80% of the time, relax to `= None` in Phase 2A or 3A.
- (−) No grep-based inventory — greenfield, so not mandatory per SESSION_RUNNER.md.

**Score: 9/10** — Deliverable met with comprehensive tests, explicit gotchas, scope discipline. Loses a point for not installing `uv` and for punting on the annual-impact default interpretation.

**Learnings added to SESSION_RUNNER.md Learnings table:** None this session. The schema code and tests are the Phase 1 institutional memory.

### What Session 2 Did
**Deliverable:** Formal architecture plan at `docs/planning/architecture-plan.md` (COMPLETE)
**Started:** 2026-04-14
**Completed:** 2026-04-14
**Commit:** See git log for hash

**What was done (in chronological order):**
1. **Orientation only (no work)** — followed Phase 0; reported state; waited for direction.
2. **Deleted `methodology_dashboard.py`** per user instruction during orientation.
3. **Jupyter → Quarto replacement** in `docs/planning/architecture-approaches.md` (3 edits: line 88, 100, 249). Replaced references with "Quarto markdown documents (.qmd) and unit-tested Python/R functions" per user directive that all code must live in tested modules.
4. **Regenerated `architecture-approaches.pdf`** via pandoc/xelatex after the edits.
5. **Governance research** — used Explore subagent to read all markdown in `/Users/rmsharp/Documents/Projects/Active_Projects/model_governance`. Findings: cycle-time taxonomy, risk tiering, first-line evidence ownership, three-pillar validation (SR 11-7), datasheets (Gebru 2021), model cards (Mitchell 2019), regulatory frameworks (SR 11-7, NAIC AIS, EU AI Act, ASOP 56). User directed: hold governance findings for formal plan, do NOT augment approaches doc.
6. **User selected approaches:** Sequential Script + LangGraph/Claude + Pydantic envelope + Code Gen Only (Quarto).
7. **Wrote `docs/planning/architecture-plan.md`** — 19 sections, ~1000 lines:
   - §1 Context, constraints, explicit scope boundary
   - §2 Decision summary (chosen approaches)
   - §3 High-level architecture with ASCII diagram
   - §4 Agent boundaries with per-agent I/O and failure mode tables
   - §5 Pydantic schemas with field-level detail (`IntakeReport`, `DataRequest`, `DataReport`, `GitLabTarget`, `GitLabProjectResult`, governance models)
   - §6 Handoff envelope protocol with schema registry and versioning rules
   - §7 Data Agent reuse interface with adapter pattern and decoupling test
   - §8 Governance integration — proportional scaffolding by risk tier + cycle time
   - §9 Technology stack with specific versions and models
   - §10 LangGraph orchestration pattern with ASCII graphs per agent
   - §11 Generated GitLab repo structure (full file tree)
   - §12 Error handling strategy (agents return reports, don't raise)
   - §13 Consolidated failure mode analysis
   - §14 Implementation phases: 6 phases across 8 implementation sessions, each with explicit DONE criteria, verification commands, and session boundary markers
   - §15 Alternatives considered (pointer to approaches doc)
   - §16 Impact analysis
   - §17 Verification plan
   - §18 Open questions (deferred decisions)
   - §19 ARCHITECTURE_WORKSTREAM verification checklist

**Key decisions baked into the plan:**
- LangGraph is used **inside each agent**, not at the top level. The top-level orchestrator is still a Sequential Script. This preserves the upgrade path.
- `GovernanceMetadata` is a new addition to `IntakeReport` beyond what `initial_purpose.txt` describes — driven by the governance research in step 5.
- Data Agent decoupling is enforced by a CI test in `tests/test_data_agent_decoupling.py` that AST-walks the Data Agent source and fails on any `IntakeReport` import.
- The Data Agent is packaged as a separate installable subpackage (`model-project-constructor-data-agent`) to physically enforce the decoupling.
- Quarto + `src/` split: all code lives in `src/` as tested functions; `.qmd` files are narratives that import from `src/`. This satisfies the user's C6 constraint.
- EDA is code-generation-only — generated `.qmd` files are NOT rendered by the pipeline; the data science team renders them. This avoids executing LLM-generated code against corporate databases.
- Governance scaffolding is proportional: tier 3+ adds three-pillar validation, tier 2+ adds impact assessment and regulatory mapping, tier 1 adds LCP integration and audit log.

**Session 1 Handoff Evaluation (Session 2 scoring Session 1):**
- **Score: 7/10**
- **What helped:** The ACTIVE TASK block clearly stated the deliverable. The Gotchas section was genuinely useful — particularly the one flagging that Step 4 is not a separate agent (prevented me from over-counting agents), the one about Data Agent decoupling having multiple approaches with different implications, and the one noting the `initial_purpose.txt` output is prose not JSON (led me to think carefully about how LLMs produce structured output). The key-files list with line numbers for `initial_purpose.txt:18-80` and `:84-87` was precise and saved a re-read.
- **What was missing:** No mention of the `model_governance` project existing. The user had to volunteer it mid-session. A "related projects" section in the handoff would have surfaced it earlier. Also: no mention that `methodology_dashboard.py` was problematic/deprecated — user asked to delete it during orientation, which suggests the previous session knew it wasn't working but didn't flag it.
- **What was wrong:** Nothing inaccurate. The handoff was honest.
- **ROI:** High. Reading the handoff took ~2 minutes and saved probably 20+ minutes of discovery work. The line-number references specifically saved re-reading full files.
- **Process note:** Session 1 did not write a Phase 1B stub (no ghost session risk because it was the first session, but it should have followed the protocol). I corrected this for Session 2 by writing the stub before any technical work.

**Session 2 Self-Assessment:**
- (+) Followed Phase 0 orientation fully before doing any work; waited for user direction.
- (+) Wrote the Phase 1B session stub before starting technical work (corrected Session 1's omission).
- (+) Did not bundle the plan with implementation — strict adherence to the "plan IS the deliverable" rule.
- (+) The plan has explicit per-phase completion criteria and verification commands (SESSION_RUNNER.md planning-session requirement).
- (+) Governance integration is first-class, not a bolt-on — it's woven through intake capture, schemas, and repo scaffolding.
- (+) Decoupling test for the Data Agent is specified at the AST level, not just as a convention.
- (+) Quarto + `src/` split directly satisfies user constraint C6.
- (+) Failure modes analyzed per-agent and consolidated globally (§4 + §13).
- (+) Alternatives explicitly rejected with honest reasons (§15).
- (-) Did not run a grep-based inventory — but this is a **greenfield** plan, not a deletion/migration/rename, so per SESSION_RUNNER.md the evidence-based inventory is not mandatory. Noted here for transparency.
- (-) §18 Open Questions has 5 items that should ideally have been resolved during planning. They are genuinely deferrable (they don't block Phase 1), but a stricter plan would have pushed on them.
- (-) The plan is long (~1000 lines). A shorter plan would be easier for a future session to read fully. However, the alternative (a short plan with vague phases) is worse because it invites bundling.
- (-) Did not verify `langgraph==0.2.x` actually supports the interrupt pattern I described for the intake review step. This should be verified in Phase 3A before implementing the intake agent. Noted as a risk in the Phase 3A session start.

**Score: 9/10** — Comprehensive, actionable, with explicit session boundaries and verification commands. Loses a point for the unverified LangGraph interrupt pattern and the 5 deferred open questions. No bundling, no scope creep, no protocol violations.

**Learnings added to SESSION_RUNNER.md Learnings table:** Not added this session. The plan itself is the learning artifact for future implementation sessions.

### What Session 1 Did
**Deliverable:** Architecture approaches document (COMPLETE)
**Started:** 2026-04-10
**Commit:** See git log for hash

**What was done:**
- Created initial commit with all project scaffolding files (18 files)
- Deep analysis of `initial_purpose.txt`, `ROADMAP.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, all methodology workstream docs
- Produced `docs/planning/architecture-approaches.md` covering 4 critical features:
  1. Pipeline Orchestration (3 approaches: Sequential Script, State Machine, Event-Driven)
  2. Technology Stack & LLM Integration (3 approaches: LangGraph+Claude, Agents SDK+GPT-4o, Custom+Mixed Models)
  3. Schema Design & Handoff Protocol (3 approaches: Pydantic Envelope, JSON Schema+Codegen, Markdown+Frontmatter)
  4. EDA & Model Building (3 approaches: Code Gen Only, Sandboxed Subprocess, Containerized)
- Each approach includes concrete pros/cons, technology names, "best suited for" guidance
- Decision dependencies table mapping which choices constrain others
- Recommended starting combination at bottom of document

**Self-Assessment:**
- (+) Thorough coverage of all 4 critical features with concrete, actionable approaches
- (+) Each approach grounded in the project's specific constraints (P&C domain, Data Agent reuse, GitLab output)
- (+) Decision dependencies table helps avoid incompatible combinations
- (+) Recommended starting point gives a pragmatic default
- (-) Did not produce the formal architecture plan — approaches doc is the prerequisite, not the final deliverable. This was the correct scope for one session.
- (-) No session stub was written before starting work (Phase 1B violation — first session, so no ghost session risk, but protocol should be followed)

**Score: 7/10** — Good approaches document with concrete detail. Loses points for missing the session stub and for not having line-number references in the approaches doc itself.

Session 1 Handoff Evaluation: N/A (first session, no predecessor)
